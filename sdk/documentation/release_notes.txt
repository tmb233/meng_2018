nRF5 SDK for Thread v0.10.0
------------------------
Release Date: Week 27, 2017
  
This release is an experimental release and should only be used to explore 
and try out the Thread features available on the nRF52840 chip.

The Thread examples in this pack are built on top of the OpenThread stack:
https://github.com/openthread/openthread

Software components and application examples for MDK, peripherals, BLE, and NFC
have been inherited from nRF5 SDK v.13.0.0.

New features:
- Initial release of Thread/BLE dynamic multiprotocol solution which allows for concurrent operation of 
  Thread and BLE utilizing OpenThread and SoftDevice stacks.
- Examples demonstrating dynamic multiprotocol operation of Thread and BLE:
	- BLE NUS (Nordic UART Service) + Thread MTD running CoAP Client
	- BLE Proximity Profile + Thread FTD running CoAP Server
	- BLE Eddystone + Thread FTD running CoAP Server 
	- BLE HRS Profile + Thread FTD running CoAP Server + FreeRTOS
	- BLE/Thread dynamic multiprotocol template application
- Example demonstrating the use of FreeRTOS with OpenThread.
- Support for IAR compiler for OpenThread stack and all example applications.

Changes:
- Updated pre-built OpenThread libraries. The update includes support for Thread/BLE dynamic multiprotocol solution and implements workaround for nRF52840 Anomaly no.110:  		  http://infocenter.nordicsemi.com/topic/com.nordic.infocenter.nrf52840.EngA.errata/anomaly_840_110.html
- Updated Thread Border Router.
- Advertising interval of BLE Eddystone Beacon Example has been modified to work with Timeslot API.

Limitations:
- Thread/BLE dynamic multiprotocol solution does not support Thread Sleepy End Device role.
- FreeRTOS does not support tickless mode.

Compatible tools:
- nrfutil-3.0.0 or newer
- nRF Thread Topology Monitor (nRF TTM) v0.8.0-1.alpha
- RaspPi-Thread-Border-Router-Demo v0.10.0-1.alpha
These tools are available from https://www.nordicsemi.com/thread#Downloads

Supported SoftDevices for multiprotocol support:
- S140 v5.0.0-2.alpha

The following OpenThread commit has been used to generate pre-built Thread
stack libraries, and for testing and verification:
- https://github.com/openthread/openthread/commit/6a15261b

The following wpantund commit has been used as part of the Thread 
Border Router solution, and for testing and verification:
https://github.com/openthread/wpantund/commit/d8259642

The following toolchains have been used for testing and verification of the
Thread examples:
- GCC: GCC ARM Embedded 4.9 2015q3
- IAR: IAR Workbench 7.60.2

Supported boards:
